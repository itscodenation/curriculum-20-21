# Unit 4: Final Project: React and Firebase Multi-User App

## Overview
In this unit, coders will work in pairs to build a project using HTML, CSS, REACT, and Firebase. Their task is to implement a React/Firebase app that requires collaboration between two or more users, be it a game or some other real time, multi-user program.. This project is intended to highlight some important aspects of goal setting and project management. The project will culminate in a final presentation.
